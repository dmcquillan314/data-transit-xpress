<div class="description"><div class="httpinterceptor-factory-page httpinterceptor-factory-sessionhttpinterceptor-page"><p>This interceptor will check the response code of a failed $http promise
and check if it has a response code of either 401 or 403.  If it does it should
retry the promise once.  This is used so that if a user&#39;s cookie expires it will cause
the 401/403, however on the failed request the cookie will be recreated.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is safe to then just rerun the request since the cookie will be there for
any subsequent requests.  However, if the cookie is not created for once reason or another
then it should not rerun the request more than once.  This is configurable via the maxInterceptions
variable.</p>
